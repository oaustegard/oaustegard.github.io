### The source-code for austegard.com

Nothing much interesting except for perhaps 
* my fork of htmlpreview in pv.html and scripts/htmlpreview.js which allows me to display html gists (like e.g. https://austegard.com/pv?a1902d995b5c6157a9eaf69afa355723 rather than the much less elegant https://htmlpreview.github.io/?gist.githubusercontent.com/oaustegard/a1902d995b5c6157a9eaf69afa355723/raw/helloworld.html)
* the tedious hand-written grid.svg which together with the 256-pixel favicon-16x16.png is what generates the large Oscar the Grouch image
