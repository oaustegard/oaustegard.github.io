## Overview

Blaster is a fast-paced arcade game where you control a ship at the bottom of the screen, defending against waves of descending enemy saucers. The game features a clean, neon-vector aesthetic, a dynamic leveling system, and procedurally generated audio for an immersive experience without external assets.

This game was created as an AI-assisted project, starting as a fork of the Asteroids game and evolving into a unique space shooter.
